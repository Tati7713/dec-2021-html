<p>The Simpson family consists of fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The
    Simpsons are a nuclear family consisting of married couple Homer and Marge and their three children Bart, Lisa, and
    Maggie. They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were
    created by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart"
    for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and were
    later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989.</p>

<h2 id="hs">Homer Simpson</h2>
<img src="https://www.seekpng.com/png/detail/439-4391636_homer-simpson-homer-simpson.png" alt="Homer">
<p>Homer Jay Simpson (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is the protagonist of the show and the father of the Simpson family.
    He embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless
    and a borderline alcoholic.[18] He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the
    situation calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his own values, including a fierce devotion to and
    protectiveness of his family. His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a
    more robust voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range
    of emotions.[11] Homer has since become one of the most influential fictional characters and has been described by
    the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time.[19] He has inspired an entire
    line of merchandise, and his catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", has been included in the Oxford English
    Dictionary.[20] During the production of the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with the idea of giving
    Homer a long lost illegitimate biological daughter, but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully, as well as
    Matt Groening rejected the idea, the writers changed the story so the clown Krusty would be the one who finds he has
    a lost daughter.</p>

<h2 id="ms">Marge Simpson</h2>
<img src="https://toleranten.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/original.jpg" alt="Marge">
<p>Marjorie Jacqueline "Marge" Simpson (née Bouvier, voiced by Julie Kavner) is the well-meaning and extremely patient
    wife of Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie. She often acts as the voice of reason, but displays exaggerated
    behavior traits of stereotypical mothers and takes the blatant dysfunctionality of her family for granted,[21]
    unlike the other family members, who are aware that they are eccentric. Her most notable physical feature is her
    blue hair, styled into an improbably high beehive. Julie Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing
    Marge in the episode "I Married Marge".[22] For her performance in The Simpsons Movie, Kavner received a nomination
    for "Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature" at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm in
    Ratatouille.[23][24] Kavner's emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she "gave
    what must be the most heartfelt performance ever".[25] Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to
    promote The Simpsons on video because she does not want to "destroy the illusion for children".[26] In 2008,
    CityNews published an article entitled "Top 10 Greatest TV Moms of All Time", and placed Marge in eighth spot.</p>

<h2 id="bs">Bart Simpson</h2>
<img src="https://all-t-shirts.ru/goods_images/ru128885II0007323449d5d28dd437c2e9335abf78196.jpg" alt="Bart">
<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) is the eldest child and only son in the family—at age
    10. Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and
    sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name "Bart" is an
    anagram of the word "brat".[28] Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child
    character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one
    person.[28] Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart.[29][30] Bart's catchphrase "Eat
    My Shorts" was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, harking back to an incident when she
    was at college.[31] In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th
    century, and the only fictional character to make the list.[32] He had previously appeared on the cover of the
    December 31, 1990 edition.[33] Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which led some parents'
    groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H.
    W. Bush to rally, "We're going to keep trying to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons
    and less like the Simpsons."[34] Bart, and other Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television
    commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990 to 2001, with the slogan "Nobody better lay a finger on
    my Butterfinger!"</p>

<h2 id="ls">Lisa Simpson</h2>
<img src="https://toleranten.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/lisa_103.jpg" alt="Lisa">
<p>Lisa Marie Simpson (voiced by Yeardley Smith) is the eldest daughter and middle child of the family. She is an
    extremely intelligent 8-year-old girl, one of the most intelligent characters on the show. Lisa's political
    convictions are generally socially liberal.[36] She is a vegetarian, and a supporter of the Free Tibet movement,[37]
    and while still supportive of the Christian church in which she was raised,[38] Lisa became a practicing Buddhist
    following her decision to follow the Noble Eightfold Path.[39] She is musically proficient on the saxophone; besides
    the occasional riff during the opening credit sequence Carole King's Jazzman and Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street have
    been prominently placed during episodes. In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was more of a "female Bart" and was
    equally mischievous. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional
    character with "Krusty Gets Busted" being one of the first episodes where her true intelligence is fully shown.[40]
    When she was a baby, Bart started out not liking her, although he became nicer to her after Marge pointed out that
    Lisa loves him. Her first word was "Bart", with Bart happily teaching her more names. Many episodes focusing on Lisa
    have an emotional nature, the first one being "Moaning Lisa". The idea for the episode was pitched by James L.
    Brooks, who had wanted to do an emotional episode where Lisa is sad because the show had done a lot of "jokey
    episodes".[41] In 2001 Lisa received a special "board of directors Ongoing Commitment Award" at the Environmental
    Media Awards.[42] "Lisa the Vegetarian", an episode from the seventh season, won both an Environmental Media Award
    for "Best Television Episodic Comedy"[43] and a Genesis Award for "Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing
    Commitment".[44] In Japan, the broadcasters of the series found they were able to turn the apparent viewer dislike
    of the series around by focusing marketing attention on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a
    voice of reason and a force of good in her family and city struck a chord with the Japanese.</p>

<h2 id="mggs">Maggie Simpson</h2>
<img src="https://2x2tv.ru/upload/iblock/e6b/e6b4bfa032f6b0a2fe3746baf6a77c8d.jpg" alt="Maggie">
<p>Margaret Evelyn Lenny "Maggie" Simpson is the youngest of the five main family members and is almost always seen as a
    baby. She has blonde spiked hair like Lisa. Her first word was "daddy", shown at one point after Homer tucks her in.
    She is almost 2 years old and still uses a pacifier despite teething, although this was mentioned in a Treehouse of
    Horror episode ("Starship Poopers") and is not considered canon. She was quite prominent in the Tracey Ullman Show
    shorts, often being featured alongside Bart and Lisa but has since become the least seen and heard of the five main
    Simpsons. It has been revealed that Maggie has outstanding artistic and academic abilities, much like her sister
    Lisa. The episodes taking place in the future often show her as some kind of businesswoman.[46]

    Maggie rarely speaks, but has been voiced by several different actors including Jodie Foster, Elizabeth Taylor,[46]
    James Earl Jones,[47] Harry Shearer (who used his Kang voice) in "Starship Poopers",[48] Yeardley Smith,[49] and
    Nancy Cartwright.</p>

<h2 id="slh">Santa's Little Helper</h2>
<img src="https://www.pngkey.com/png/detail/136-1362762_santas-little-helper-ayudante-de-santa-simpson.png" alt="Dog">
<p>Santa's Little Helper (voiced by Frank Welker[92] and Dan Castellaneta[78]) – Santa's Little Helper is the Simpsons'
    pet greyhound. He first appeared in "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" as a race dog adopted by Homer and Bart and
    has been in the series since.[92] While usually well-behaved, he can be vicious at times, having a female dog giving
    birth to 25 puppies which angers Bart at first, although Bart loves and cares for him deeply.</p>

<h2 id="s2">Snowball II</h2>
<img src="http://images.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Snowball-II-Wallpaper-the-simpsons-pets-and-animals-644119_1024_768.gif" alt="Cat">
<p>Snowball II – Snowball II was the Simpson family's second cat. Although Snowball I had white fur, which inspired her
    name, Snowball II had black fur. She first appeared in the series premiere but has received little attention in the
    series. Snowball II and Santa's Little Helper have always been shown as having a good relationship; usually they are
    seen sleeping near each other. Snowball II's largest role is in the fourteenth season episode "Old Yeller Belly", in
    which she saves Homer from a burning treehouse. She also has minor roles in "Bart Gets an Elephant", where she tries
    to get attention; in "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds", in which she is scared by the many puppies; and in "Make Room
    for Lisa", in which Lisa has a hallucination where she becomes Snowball II.</p>
